# PYTdownloader
A simple python youtube downloader written using the pytube and moviepy libraries. Has a simple GUI made using Tkinter. This is a project I did a long while ago, it's very sloppy and has a lot of unessecary stuff in it. Besides all that, it's an excellent and simplistic youtube downloader that does exactly what you'd expect.

To use PYTdownloader you first need to install the pytube and moviepy libraries (downloadable via pip). The program works by downloading the youtubevideo(s) and then converting it from .mp4 to .mp3.

If you want to use the program, download it and place it in a folder. Make a new .txt file named 'Adownloads.txt' and paste all your Youtube links that you wanted downloaded in the .txt file. Remember to make every link a seperate line (see the included ADownloads.txt, with Belgian hiphop). Then execute the .py, choose the folder you want to music to be in and then you can choose wether you want the program to delete the video and just keep the .mp3, or to not convert the videos, or to keep both.
