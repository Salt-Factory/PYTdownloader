# PYTdownloader
A python youtube downloader written using the pytube and moviepy libraries. Has a simple GUI made using Tkinter. This is a project I did a long while ago, it's very sloppy and has a lot of unessecary stuff in it. Besides all that, it's an excellent and simplistic youtube downloader that does exactly what you'd expect.
